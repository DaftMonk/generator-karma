# Testacular generator [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/yeoman/generator-testacular.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/yeoman/generator-testacular)

Maintainer: [Brian Ford](https://github.com/btford)

## Usage

Running `yo testacular` will generate a `testacular.conf.js` file for your project.

Note that you'll need to install the `gruntacular` plugin for grunt and update your `Gruntfile.js`. If you're using testacular through the [AngularJS](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular) generator, all of the configuration is done for you.
